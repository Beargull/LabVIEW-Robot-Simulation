# LabVIEW-Robot-Simulation
Part of my coursework for a mechatronics module. Simulates all the features of a line following robot with Microsoft TTS integrated for warnings.  Can replace the simulated sensor inputs with real inputs for a robot. Can be simplified and edited.

If you are 2nd year Mechanical Engineer at SHU in 2020/21 and want help understanding the code, you'll probably be able to find me
